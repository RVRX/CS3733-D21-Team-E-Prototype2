### QR Code:

There is a button on the main page of the app that opens the device’s default camera to allow the user to scan a QR code with the view finder.
The QR codes are going to be found inside the hospital so the user can get their phone out and quickly scan for information.
There are two kinds of QR codes, one for precise indoor locating and one for parking slot registration.
It allows the app to know where the user is currently is, so it can direct the user to somewhere without the need of locating satellites since it was indoors and has multiple floors.
The parking slot codes allow the user to keep track of their parked location with the app, they can click a link on their default page to be taken to their car.
